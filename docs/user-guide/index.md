# User Guide

The following sections detail how Ignition works and how it may be used to build a VIM/Lifecycle driver:

**Contents:**

It is best to start with [Create a Driver](./creating-a-driver.md) to build, configure and deploy a new driver.

Once you have completed that guide, you can check out advanced topics:

- [Bootstrap Services](./framework/index.md) - read about the services Ignition provides out-of-the-box and how you may configure and integrate with them
- [Error Handling](./apis-error-handling.md) - configure the HTTP response when returning different types of errors from your Python code
- [Add Custom APIs](./add-custom-apis.md) - add custom APIs to a driver
- [Add Custom Properties](./add-custom-properties.md) - add custom properties to a driver to be configured at deployment
